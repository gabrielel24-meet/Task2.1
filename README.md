# EdVance

## Description
**EdVance** is a platform for teachers in the region.

Our platform is designed to help teachers teach better, by creating lesson plans that include more effective methods of teaching, that will help students to understand the material better. In addition, the app implements in the lessons 21st century necessary life skills (critical thinking, working in groups, problem solving, etc), so students will leave school more prepared for life / work life itself. 

## Main Features
The platform plans the lessons, using **AI**. The teacher, very basiclly, asks for the AI to create a lesson plan according to the metirial & the skill he/she wants to teach, and the AI generates it!

The app lets every student to have a user. Above the students, every teacher will have a user, that is able to supervise over his/her students. Above the teacher there is the administrator / the rest of the directory, who can supervise over all that is going on. 

The teacher / directory will be able to supervise over students grades, development, time learning on the app and more future features to come.
